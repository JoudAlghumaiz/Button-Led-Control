# Button LED Control - Arduino Project

This project uses an Arduino UNO to control 3 LEDs with 3 push buttons.
Each button turns on a corresponding LED using digital pins.

## ğŸ”§ Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- 3x LEDs
- 3x Push Buttons
- 3x 220Î© resistors (for LEDs)
- 3x 10kÎ© resistors (pull-down for buttons)
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## ğŸ”Œ Circuit
Each button is connected with a 10kÎ© pull-down resistor to avoid floating input.
Each LED is connected with a 220Î© resistor to limit current.

> Check the included circuit diagram for wiring.
